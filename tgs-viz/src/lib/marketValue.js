/**
 * Market Value Calculator — FA-market-fitted $ layer.
 *
 * METHODOLOGY (v3, 2026-08-07). v1 divided TOTAL payroll by wins above
 * AVERAGE, pricing a win ~3x the real market. v2 fitted the actual FA market.
 * v3 fixes four measurement defects in v2's fit; every constant below is
 * measured from the league's own data at load time.
 *
 * 1. SAMPLE — fresh free-agent signings only: MLB players in year 1 of their
 *    contract (ContractYr === 1) whose service AT SIGNING was >= 6 service
 *    YEARS, tested in DAYS:
 *        serviceDaysAtSigning = MLBSvcDays - MLBSvcDaysTY  >=  6 * 172
 *    (the deal started this season, so this season's accrual came after the
 *    signature). v2 tested the INTEGER MLBSvcYrs, which is up to a year loose
 *    because that field is service NOW: a player who signed at 5.2 years and
 *    then played a full season reads as 6, so pre-free-agency EXTENSIONS
 *    entered the sample. They are 63% of the old TGS sample and 15% of BLM's,
 *    and they price ~$1.8M/yr BELOW the line at matched WAR in both leagues
 *    (measured), dragging the slope down and the floor up.
 *
 *    A service YEAR is 172 DAYS — MEASURED, not assumed. Route A (identity):
 *    mlb_service_years === floor(mlb_service_days / L) holds for L = 172 and
 *    for no other L in 120..210, over every player rostered in the MLB world
 *    (8,578 TGS / 13,876 BLM; the only violators anywhere are ex-NPB/KBO free
 *    agents in the TGS pool, who accrued service on a foreign league's shorter
 *    clock). Route B (economics, independent): with service measured AT
 *    SIGNING the salary ladder's arbitration step lands exactly between the
 *    2.000-3.000 and 3.000-4.000 service buckets in both leagues (at-minimum
 *    share TGS 55% -> 4%, BLM 80% -> 3%), and BLM's free-agency step (the
 *    onset of multi-year deals) peaks at 1012 days vs 6*172 = 1032.
 *    See ingest/statsplus.py for the field semantics.
 *
 * 2. CURRENCY — WAR = WAA + the MEASURED per-league **MARKET** replacement
 *    offsets from leagueCalib.js (replacementMarket: what freely-available
 *    talent produces). Salary clears against what a team could sign for FREE —
 *    the open-market floor — not against an org's own depth (replacementOrg,
 *    which only the rosterOptimizer's internal cut/keep uses).
 *
 * 3. RESPONSE = AAV, not year-1 price: sum(SalarySchedule)/years. Year 1 of a
 *    backloaded deal is not what the market paid. (Measured effect is small —
 *    schedules are near-flat in BOTH leagues, mean |AAV-Price|/Price 2.8% TGS
 *    / 1.5% BLM — but AAV is the correct variable and multi-year deals are
 *    ~half the sample.)
 *
 * 4. FLOOR — fitted with the intercept PINNED at the league minimum salary,
 *    which is itself MEASURED per league (measureLeagueMinimum: the modal
 *    salary among MLB players on a <=1-year deal who were pre-arb at signing —
 *    OOTP renews exactly those at the minimum; the mode carries 89% of that
 *    pool in TGS, 93% in BLM). Justification is empirical, not assumed: with
 *    the offsets fixed and the extensions removed, the FREE intercept is
 *    statistically indistinguishable from the measured minimum in every one of
 *    the six league x cell fits (t = -0.81/-0.18/-0.97 TGS,
 *    -0.60/+0.11/+0.25 BLM), and pinning tightens the slope CI by 45-53%.
 *    The pin is GATED at load by the same 1-SE rule as everything else: it
 *    ships unless the free line predicts better out of sample by more than one
 *    CV standard error. Measured: pinned wins outright in 5 of 6 cells; in the
 *    TGS pooled cell it is 0.63 SE worse, inside the tolerance, so it is kept.
 *    `floorMode` records which shipped.
 *
 * 5. SHAPE — a curvature term IS fitted (quadratic through the same floor) but
 *    it only ships if ALL FOUR gates hold: (a) monotone increasing over
 *    [0, top observed WAR]; (b) beats the line OUT OF SAMPLE by more than one
 *    CV standard error (the standard 1-SE rule, parsimony to the line);
 *    (c) its own deterministic bootstrap 95% CI excludes zero; (d) STABILITY —
 *    the verdict must survive dropping any single signing.
 *
 *    Measured on the current data: the curvature is REAL but NOT ESTABLISHED,
 *    so BOTH leagues ship straight lines and the audit's convexity finding is
 *    recorded as blocked on sample size, not implemented.
 *      TGS pooled  curv +$1.29M/WAR^2, bootstrap CI [+0.32, +2.14] (excludes
 *                  zero), OOS -4.8% vs the line at paired t=-1.01 — i.e. it
 *                  passed (a),(b),(c) by a hair and then FAILED (d): the very
 *                  first leave-one-out reversed it. Over the full jackknife the
 *                  curve held in only 13 of 55 drops.
 *      BLM pooled  curv +$0.72M/WAR^2, CI [+0.09, +1.31] (also excludes zero),
 *                  OOS -2.0% at t=-0.85 — fails (b). Its LINE is equally
 *                  fragile: it held in only 19 of 66 drops.
 *      role cells  all four rejected (n=23-43; CIs include zero; BLM's pitcher
 *                  quadratic is not even monotone).
 *    Read that as: both leagues' pooled samples show the SAME positive
 *    curvature with a CI excluding zero, which is real evidence that the audit
 *    was right about the shape — but at n=55/66 with a $6-9M residual SD the
 *    predictive test cannot tell a line from a curve, and a single contract
 *    flips it either way. Since adopting the curve would re-price a 4-WAR
 *    player by +$9.18M/yr and a 1-WAR player by -$1.77M/yr (almost exactly the
 *    audit's $8.8M and $1.7M), that is far too much movement to hang on one
 *    signing. Bank another offseason and re-read.
 *
 *    CAVEAT ON THE GATES THEMSELVES (adversarial verify pass, 2026-08-07) —
 *    "the gate turns the curve on by itself when the sample can carry it" is
 *    NOT true as implemented, and the two shape verdicts are less decisive
 *    than the numbers above read:
 *      (b) is SEED-DEPENDENT. Re-running the same paired CV over 200
 *          independent fold assignments: TGS t = -0.967 +/- 0.086, firing in
 *          37% of seeds; BLM t = -1.080 +/- 0.113, firing in 76%. The shipped
 *          CV_SEED draws -1.01 for TGS (fires) and -0.85 for BLM (does not) —
 *          BLM's rejection is roughly a bottom-quartile draw, not a finding.
 *          The gate is measuring CV noise as much as it is measuring the data.
 *      (d) is effectively UNPASSABLE, and gets stricter as the sample grows.
 *          It requires all n single-drop re-runs to independently clear the
 *          same noisy (b), so P(pass) ~ p^n: measured per-drop p = 0.27 (TGS,
 *          9e-32 over 55 drops) and 0.91 (BLM, 0.002 over 66). Banking more
 *          offseasons RAISES n and therefore LOWERS the chance the gate ever
 *          fires. It is a conservative failsafe, not a test that can turn on.
 *      What the data actually says, gates aside: TGS's curve IS fragile —
 *          dropping the top 2 signings by WAR puts its bootstrap CI back
 *          across zero, and dropping the top 5 collapses curv +1.29 -> +0.05.
 *          BLM's is sturdier under leave-one-out (60 of 66 drops hold) but
 *          equally dependent on its top handful (top-1 drop already recrosses
 *          zero). Both leagues' curvature rests on 2-5 contracts.
 *      Shipping the LINE remains the right call — a curve re-prices a 4-WAR
 *          player by ~+$9M/yr on that evidence — but if the shape is ever
 *          revisited, REPLACE gates (b)/(d) (e.g. average the paired t over
 *          many seeds; make stability a fraction-of-drops threshold rather
 *          than unanimity) rather than reading the current verdicts as
 *          measurements.
 *
 * 6. PER-ROLE vs POOLED — decided OUT OF SAMPLE per role, not assumed. v2 split
 *    hitter/pitcher on the theory that the two FLOORS meant different things;
 *    with the floor pinned that rationale is gone, so the only question left is
 *    whether the SLOPES differ. Each role uses its own line only when that line
 *    predicts its own signings better than the pooled fit under repeated
 *    k-fold CV (1-SE rule, parsimony to one shared line). Measured:
 *      TGS POOLS. Its role lines are $6.67M/WAR (hitter) and $5.52M/WAR
 *      (pitcher) — 17% apart, slope-difference t = 1.36, and each is ~2% WORSE
 *      than the pooled line out of sample. That is the audit's predicted
 *      post-offset-fix result: once the extensions are out and the offsets are
 *      right, the two roles buy wins at the same price, so one line ships
 *      ($5.98M/WAR) and the roles agree by construction.
 *      BLM SPLITS, and this is a REAL disagreement, not a fixable one:
 *      hitter $6.52M/WAR vs pitcher $2.71M/WAR (t = 4.57, CIs [5.10,7.93] and
 *      [1.90,3.52] do not overlap), and each role's own line is ~15% better out
 *      of sample. BLM's FA pitcher market is genuinely flat: r2 0.16, 14 of 43
 *      signings are relievers, its starters span only 1.40-3.59 projected WAR
 *      (nobody signed a high-WAR SP that offseason), and three pitchers
 *      projected at 1.96-2.72 WAR signed for the $0.70M league minimum. This is
 *      a data limitation of BLM's single banked offseason, and it is the one
 *      gate in this work that does NOT pass — see the report.
 *
 * 7. NO EXTRAPOLATION — applies to the CURVE: a quadratic is never evaluated
 *    above the highest WAR the market has actually priced (`maxX`); queries
 *    above it are answered AT that tier, the same rule localFit already used.
 *    A straight LINE is left free to extrapolate as it always did — see
 *    cellPrice for why.
 *
 * 8. TWO ECONOMIES — the fitted line is kept for surplus/value display ("line
 *    value"), but actual prices depart from it at the top. FAIR OFFERS are
 *    TIER-LOCAL: a LOESS-style local linear regression (tricube kernel, span
 *    0.4 — standard LOESS conventions) over the actual signings of
 *    comparable-WAR players. The replaceable/scarcity boundary is WHERE THE
 *    LOCAL PRICE DEPARTS THE LINE BY > 1 FITTED RESIDUAL SD and stays there
 *    over at least MIN_TIER_XS distinct observed WAR values
 *    (computeScarcityBoundary — the run requirement is v3: without it the
 *    "boundary" degenerated to the single top signing, i.e. a tier of one).
 *
 *    v3.1 (adversarial verify pass, 2026-08-07): the local price is now also
 *    bounded in **y** by the actual signings inside its own window — see
 *    localFit. Before that bound BLM's hitter offer curve quoted $60.56M at
 *    3.0 WAR, above the largest contract in the league ($49.87M). Fitted
 *    coefficients are unaffected (verified byte-identical); only the offer
 *    path and the scarcity boundary read localFit.
 *
 *    KNOWN, NOT FIXED — the LOESS offer curve is NOT MONOTONE in WAR where
 *    the sample is thin. Measured on the shipped data (0.1-WAR grid):
 *      TGS pooled  monotone in practice (one $30K dip at 0.1 WAR, n=55).
 *      BLM hitter  20 decreasing steps: 1.5 WAR -> $13.4M, 2.0 -> $9.9M,
 *                  3.0 -> $49.9M, 3.5 -> $31.4M, 5.0 -> $30.2M (n=23).
 *      BLM pitcher 17 decreasing steps: 0.0 -> $4.1M, 1.5 -> $2.3M,
 *                  3.0 -> $6.2M, 3.5 -> $19.8M (n=43).
 *    So in BLM the "Fair AAV" column can offer a worse player more than a
 *    better one. The cause is a local LINE fitted across gaps in a 23/43-point
 *    sample, not a coding error, and the honest fixes (isotonic/PAV smoothing,
 *    or a monotonicity constraint on the local fit) are a methodology change
 *    that would move every offer in the app — deliberately NOT made during a
 *    verification pass. Re-read after BLM banks a second offseason; if the
 *    curve is still non-monotone at n~130, constrain it. TGS is unaffected.
 * 9. VALUATION — multi-year: for each remaining SalarySchedule year y,
 *      surplus_y = (priceAt(agedWAR_y) - salary_y) * 0.97^y
 *    with agedWAR via futureValue's getAgingFactor schedule, anchored so that
 *    agedWAR_0 = today's WAR (the same basis the fit regressed on). 0.97 is
 *    futureValue's DISCOUNT_RATE (3%/yr time value).
 *    The FAIR-OFFER horizon is the player's OWN remaining control
 *    (serviceTime.controlWindow: service days vs the signed schedule), not the
 *    flat six years this file used to assume for everybody.
 *
 * WHAT REMAINS HEURISTIC OR CONVENTION (clearly labeled, not fitted):
 * - The aging schedule itself (futureValue FV_DEFAULTS, INTERIM per the
 *   2026-08-05 directive — unmeasured until the aging harness runs).
 * - Band width "1 SD" and the LOESS kernel/span (tricube, 0.4) are standard
 *   conventions; the dispersions themselves are fitted from real signings.
 * - CV protocol constants (10 folds, 20 repeats, "beat by 1 paired SE"): the
 *   standard one-standard-error model-selection rule. The comparisons
 *   themselves are data. The stability gate ("no single observation may
 *   reverse the verdict") is likewise a stated robustness convention, not a
 *   tuned threshold.
 * - Bootstrap B = 1000, seeded. Deterministic on purpose: the same data must
 *   always ship the same line.
 * - MIN_TIER_XS = 3: a scarcity "tier" has to contain more than one or two
 *   signings. A convention, but a necessary one — without it the boundary
 *   degenerated to the single top signing. On the current data no run of 3
 *   survives in either league, so the boundary is null and every player is
 *   labelled "replaceable"; the tier-local premium is still paid through the
 *   LOESS offer path, which is where it belongs.
 * - Per-role minimum sample n >= 10 before a role line is even considered
 *   (small-sample guard).
 * - Prospect development risk is priced inside futureValue's risk factor
 *   (0.80-0.95, itself labeled heuristic there).
 * - Market value is floored at $0/yr (you can release a negative-WAR player
 *   and pay a replacement nothing — value can't go below the walk-away point).
 *
 * KNOWN LIMITS (data, not code):
 * - Sample size. The honest filter leaves n=55 TGS / n=66 BLM fresh FA
 *   signings; per-role n is 23-43. Slope CIs are wide and every offseason's
 *   bank should re-tighten them.
 * - Vintage. The fit regresses THIS season's projected WAR on a price set in
 *   the previous offseason. TGS's snapshot is a full season after signing
 *   (in-game 2044-10-20, deals dated 2044); BLM's is ~2 months after
 *   (2058-05-27, deals dated 2058).
 * - Mid-season signings. serviceDaysAtSigning credits the whole current-season
 *   accrual to after the signature, so a player signed mid-season is credited
 *   up to `MLBSvcDaysTY` days too little. That biases toward EXCLUDING, never
 *   toward admitting an extension.
