/**
 * TGS Future Value Calculator v2
 *
 * Research-backed model using actual WAA data from the TGS sheets.
 *
 * Key design decisions (backed by data analysis + sabermetric research):
 * - Development S-curve (logistic) with maturity at age 25 (OOTP default)
 * - No plateau: INTERIM decline schedule from age 26 (~6%/yr, 9%/yr past 31) —
 *   see FV_DEFAULTS; unmeasured until the aging harness runs (audit Phase C)
 * - Valuation counts a FIXED number of controlled seasons from expected
 *   arrival (D5 audit fix) — the window no longer shrinks for young prospects
 * - Risk factor 0.80-0.95 range (generous — sheets already discount via conservative potential ratings)
 * - 3% annual time discount (mild — we're rating talent, not contract surplus)
 * - NO positional scarcity bonus (WAA already includes defense)
 * - Percentile-based 20-80 FV scale calibration
 *
 * Data insights:
 * - Potential data only exists for ages 16-23 (hard cutoff)
 * - Only 3.2% of hitters currently above 0 WAA; 20% of prospects have potential >= 0
 * - Development GAP: ~8 WAA at age 16, ~2 WAA at age 23 (hitters)
 * - 56 hitters (1.5%) have potential >= 3.0 WAA (elite tier)
 *
 * Sources:
 * - FanGraphs aging curve research (peak ~27, decline ~0.5 WAR/yr after 30)
 * - Yale study (Fair, April 2025): peak performance age ~27.5 hitters, ~26.5 pitchers
 * - OOTP mechanics: development stops at 25, aging curve kicks in ~30
 * - FanGraphs prospect valuation: 8% discount for contract surplus (we use 3% for talent rating)
