/**
 * waivers.js — waiver / DFA claim board.
 *
 * Every roster row already ships `OnWaivers` and `DFA`; nothing surfaced them,
 * so free talent passed by unnoticed. This module answers the only question a
 * claim actually poses: is this man worth a roster spot to US?
 *
 * VALUE BASIS — ORG replacement ("next man up"), leagueCalib.replacementOrg.
 * A claim is an INTERNAL cut/keep decision: the alternative to claiming him is
 * the body already holding the spot, not what the open market sells. That is
 * precisely the question replacementOrg was measured for (see leagueCalib.js
 * header), so `vor` = role WAA + the measured org offset for that role. The
 * market offsets (the $ currency) are deliberately NOT used here.
 *
 * DISPLAY stays WAA — `waa` is the raw value-vs-average the boards show; `vor`
 * is labelled as value above ORG replacement wherever it appears, never as WAA.
 *
 * ROSTER FIT is measured against the claiming org's OWN players: the weakest
 * MLB-level body in the same role bucket is the man he would push off. No
 * 40-man logic: the data carries no 40-man flag, so this module never counts
 * roster spots it cannot see.
 *
 * Everything numeric here comes from the league's own shipped rows or from the
 * measured per-league offsets — there are no constants in this file.
